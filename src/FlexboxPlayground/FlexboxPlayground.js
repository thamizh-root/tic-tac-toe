        <div class="two">In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was
being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest
circles, between the parties of Rumyantsev, the French,
Marya Fedorovna, the Tsarevich, and others, drowned as
usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,
luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about
phantoms and reflections of real life, went on in its old
way and made it hard, except by a great effort, to realize
the danger and the difficult position of the Russian
people. There were the same receptions and balls, the
same French theater, the same court interests and service
interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest
circles were attempts made to keep in mind the
difficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered
of how differently the two Empresses behaved in these
difficult circumstances. The Empress Marya, concerned
for the welfare of the charitable and educational
institutions under her patronage, had given directions that
they should all be removed to Kazan, and the things
belonging to these institutions had already been packed
up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what
instructions she would be pleased to give- with her

characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she
could give no directions about state institutions for that
was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she
personally was concerned she would be the last to quit
Petersburg.
At Anna Pavlovna’s on the twenty-sixth of August, the
very day of the battle of Borodino, there was a soiree, the
chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter
from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the Emperor
an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a
model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vasili
himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. (He used
to read at the Empress’.) The art of his reading was
supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite
independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong
voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender
murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random on one word
and the murmur on another. This reading, as was always
the case at Anna Pavlovna’s soirees, had a political
significance. That evening she expected several important
personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to
the French theater and aroused to a patriotic temper. A
good many people had already arrived, but Anna
Pavlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in.
