//
//  Width Algorithm:

// Width respects the parentâ€™s container size, while
// Height respects its own content size

// The height and width algorithms act similarly in that both use min-, max-, and the base value to clamp and constrain the computed size. 
// The crucial difference is how each element calculates its natural size: width stretches to fill its container by default, 
// whereas height only grows as large as its content requires unless explicitly set.
